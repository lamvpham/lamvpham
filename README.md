## I'm Lam, a product designer graduating from Systems Design Engineering @ the University of Waterloo ☀️

As a designer who's curious about cognitive science, the crossroads of technology + the creative arts, and user experiences, the feeling of empowering people and inspiring moments of joy is at the heart of what I do.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about innovative applications of technology, and the psychology of HCI within + outside of design - which you can learn more about on my portfolio: [https://lamvpham.com/](https://lamvpham.com/)
